# scandas

*scandas* is a data manipulation and analysis library. It can load "tabular" mixed type (i.e., categorical, continuous, integer, timestamp) data from a variety of data sources into a single object, called `Dataset`, for easy row/column manipulations.  It can be used for loading, cleaning, summarizing, analysing a dataset, but can also be used to implement algorithms that act on the dataset as well.

The name *scandas* comes from "**sc**alable p**an**el **da**ta analysi**s**". The term "panel data" comes from economics and just means tabular data.
